Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These seizures are caused by sudden surges of electrical activity in the brain that affect how a person appears or acts for a short time.

There are different types of seizures:
1. Focal seizures – affect a small part of the brain.
2. Generalized seizures – affect both sides of the brain.
3. Absence seizures – brief, sudden lapses in attention.
4. Tonic-clonic seizures – involve stiffening (tonic) and jerking (clonic) phases.

Common triggers include:
- Sleep deprivation
- Stress or anxiety
- Flashing lights or patterns
- Skipping medication
- Hormonal changes

Safety Tips for People with Epilepsy:
- Avoid swimming alone or climbing heights
- Always take medication on time
- Wear medical alert jewelry
- Inform close contacts about seizure first aid

Aura Stage:
Many patients experience an “aura” before a seizure — a warning phase involving unusual sensations like smells, tastes, visual changes, or anxiety.

When to Seek Emergency Care:
- Seizure lasts more than 5 minutes
- Another seizure begins immediately after one ends
- Injury occurs during the seizure
- Breathing problems follow the seizure

Lifestyle Management:
- Maintain regular sleep
- Keep a seizure diary
- Eat balanced meals
- Avoid alcohol and drugs

While epilepsy cannot always be cured, most people with epilepsy lead full, active lives with proper treatment and precautions.

No Seizure Risk means the patient is currently not showing signs of a possible seizure. This may result from effective medication, proper sleep, low stress levels, or absence of seizure triggers. It does not mean epilepsy is cured, but it indicates current stability.
